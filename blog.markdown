I've been attending the london gopher meetup for around several months and has always been well represented on the day. There where two main talks yesterday hosted by Diveleroo based on 'Go Scratch Tensorflow by Dom Green' and 'How do I visualise data I know nothing about? By Ilan Pillemer'.

I found it interesting how Machine Learning app Tensorflow can be integrated with go. And how D3 also works well with go in your data analytics and graphs.

Go developers will be leasing updates for 1.14 version of golang soon. But as a recent observation, go is now suitable for frontend development with the introduction of webassembly. Bring an end to Javascripts dominance over the internet browser. Still early days yet, but will probably be a game changer based on how we consumer apps overtime and what can be built using go frontend as well as the traditional backend.
