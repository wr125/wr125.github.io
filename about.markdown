My name is Robert Willis and i am a Gopher project manager / developer. I've been writing go code for about 4 years. What I like best about go is its statically typed codebase. Its structured in terms of layout and also flexible in terms of easy of use.

The language of go seems ideal for web, mobile and desktop use cases. The reason for this site blog is to try and document my experiences using and interacting with go (also known as golang). Do following on github.com.
